# 01) Hello! OMG, Welcome! It's Symfony Flex Time!

Yo! I am Ryan! My trusty wingman is Ivan

## SETUP NOTES!

A) In your VM (in any directory) run the cmd found here:

    http://bit.ly/prime-composer-cache

B) Open a terminal and update the project:

    cd /var/www/html/summercamp/phpflex
    git pull
    composer install

--> Btw, this slide is located at: `_slides/01-hello.md`

C) Open the directory in PhpStorm!

D) Go to PhpStorm's Settings and enable the Symfony plugin
    http://bit.ly/sf-plugin-enable

E) Say hello to your neighbor!

F) Later, go swimming!

SUCCESS WHEN:

You should have a populated `vendor/` directory and
a basic - but (if I might say) an elegant - project
structure (`config/`, `public/`, `src/`).

Also, you should know your neighbor!
